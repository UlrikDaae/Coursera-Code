# Coursera-Code
Hello, 
Here you will find all my code used to solve the Coursera courses I've taken. As a teacher myself I have struggled a lot with learning programming, and these challenges can be – to put it mildly – challenging. Not all courses have as good explanations as I wish they had, and many have a steep learning curve. This makes it difficult to solve the tasks. 

Because of that I have opted to share my code **with explanations** so that you can solve the challenges with an added guide. **DO NOT** simply copy-paste my code as a solution. You're paying for Coursera-courses to learn, not cheat. This is simply meant as an added help for those who find it difficult to progess. 

Best Wishes, 

Ulrik
